Jenkins assignment:

Task 1:

1. Clone this github repo : https://github.com/ExlearnTechnologies/Hello-World-SpringBoot.git
2. Create a repo in your GitHub account and Push the code to your repo.
3. Create a Freestyle Build Job, Test Job, Package Job and Deploy Job.
4. Connect these jobs using post build actions (Upstream and Downstream)
5. Configure Build job and trigger it periodically
6. Set the cron to trigger the job every 15 minutes ( visit Cronguru if you are not sure on setting the cron for every 15 minutes)
7. Let the Build job get triggered automatically and see if the downstream jobs are getting triggered automatically. 

If the jobs don't get triggered automatically then you must have made some mistake, so please go through session recordings.

Task 2:

1. Use the same repo as above
2. This time create a pipeline job.
3. Write a pipeline script which has 5 stages, i.e. clone, compile, test, package and deploy 
(Don't use the same script which you will find in repo. In the repo script we have given the git command in every stage, but here we want you to create a separate stage for git clone at the beginning. In rest of the stages remove git command and keep only mvn commands.

4. Paste the script in pipeline script and build the job
5. Next push this script to Github repo. Name the file as Jenkinsfile
6. Now configure the pipeline job to use pipeline script from SCM.
7. Trigger the job. This time it should pick the script from your repo.
